cv2 library: OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

RGB means Red Green Blue, ie the primary colors in additive color synthesis. A RGB file consists in composite layers of Red, Gree and Blue, each being coded on 256 levels from 0 to 255.

In this task,

first we need to import the cv2 library then find an image that you want to convert to a pencil sketch with Python, read that image by image= cv2.imread,

then we need to read the image in RGB format by img_rgb= cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

and then convert it to a grayscale image gray_image= cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY),

invert the grayscale image also called negative image by inverted_image= 255 - gray_image

then convert it into blurry image(Gaussian function) blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(inverted_image, (21, 21), 0),

by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image inverted_blurred = 255 - blurred

then finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image pencil_sketch = cv2.divide(gray_image, inverted_blurred, scale=256.0)

And to Display image at anytime cv2.imshow("Chit Sketch", pencil_sketch) cv2.waitKey(0)

Steps: read image--> RGB Format--> grayscale image-->inverted grayscale(negative image)-->blurry image(gaussian function)-->inverted blurr-->gray image+inverted blurr

4)Image to Pencil Sketch with Python:

We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.
